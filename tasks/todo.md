# Todo

This ledger contains current work only. Completed delivery history remains in
Git, merged pull requests, dated ADRs, and `docs/superpowers/`. Capability
status is authoritative in `docs/Capabilities.md`.

## Maintenance delivery

Documentation, state-ownership, and browser-diagnostic maintenance uses the
same acceptance requirements as other code changes: review the final commit,
require all six hosted acceptance jobs before integration, and verify the
integrated `main` commit. A successful baseline run does not prove later
changes, and local verification does not replace hosted proof.

## Manual and credential-gated acceptance

- [ ] Exercise the AppKit accessibility adapter with VoiceOver and the UIKit
      path with a screen reader. Automated tests prove the derived text and
      bridge, not real assistive-technology interaction.
- [ ] Run the Developer ID signing and notarization path with valid credentials
      before describing the notarized macOS artifact as proven.
- [ ] Run the supplemental macOS shell smoke for Dock reopen, multi-window
      focus, close behavior, and Command-Q. Automated offscreen tests remain
      the gate; this item records the separate human-facing layer.

## Deferred product scope

These are not committed implementation work. Each needs a new accepted design
before execution:

- Tier 2 dynamically loaded plugins and Tier 3 out-of-process plugins.
- A versioned network capability and stronger filesystem/symlink confinement.
- UIKit-native scene ownership, Windows GUI hosting, and physical Embedded
  hardware acceptance.
- Additional distribution formats: Embed SDK, Linux/Windows staged products,
  Android release/keystore packaging, CLI veneer, and iOS-family archives.
