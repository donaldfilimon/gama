# Goals

## Ship the Swift 6.4 Gama Framework

status: done

- Apple Swift 6.4 debug, 73 tests, release, and iOS/tvOS/visionOS compile:
  locally green.
- Portable core, macros, drawing, TUI, Apple UI, C ABI, WASM, MLIR, and Qt
  adapter sources: implemented; Qt 6.11 and MLIR parser gates are locally green.
- Exact 2026-08-14 Swift 6.4 snapshot and matching Linux, WASM, and Android
  SDKs: checksum-pinned and locally installed; Linux, WASM runtime, Android
  arm64/x86_64 cross-build, JNI packaging, API 36 emulator input/frame round
  trip, and Embedded compile/link gates pass.
- Hosted Linux, Windows, WASM, Android/emulator, and required PR checks: pending.
- Merge is forbidden until the required matrix is green.
- Outcome: merged as PR #6; hosted "Gama acceptance" matrix green on main at
  f509e2c (2026-08-24). Superseded going forward by the umbrella goal below
  (6.5-dev snapshot, Qt adapter removed 2026-08-26).

## Build the Gama umbrella application framework

status: in_progress

- Intention (Donald, 2026-08-26): a cross-platform, macro/plugin-based
  UI/UX/application framework in Swift — Tauri/React-Native-class — spanning
  WASM, Windows, macOS desktop, Embedded, and more, with the retained-IR
  renderer as the foundation (own-the-rendering decision).
- Sub-project 1 (foundation) Current: canonical checkout adopted at
  ~/Desktop/Gama on the donaldfilimon/gama history; migrated to swiftly
  main-snapshot-2026-08-21 (Swift 6.5-dev); Qt adapter removed; all eight
  local gates green; CI migration open as PR #7 — matrix pending, merge
  gated on green.
- Sub-projects 2-4 Proposed (specs to be brainstormed separately): plugin
  runtime + capability model; app shell/windowing/lifecycle; packaging &
  distribution. Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-26-gama-umbrella-foundation-design.md
